# RRT-Path-Planning
An RRT path planning algorithm in MATLAB that calculates 100 paths through a known field with obstacles to reach the endzone. The program utilizes Kalman Filter to track uncertainty.  The program produces 3 plots: the shortest path, path with least uncertainty, and the path with greatest uncertainty.
